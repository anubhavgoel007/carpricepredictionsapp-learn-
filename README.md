# Car Price Predictions
  Car Price Predictor takes various inputs of a car's build year, type, intial selling price etc. to predict the current price of the car. This Application has mostly been borrowed from Youtube(@KrishNaik) for learning purposes.

#Description:
  The Dataset was taken from Kaggle (CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv).
  Used virtual Anaconda environment and performed in jupyter notebook and later used Spyder for HTML and flask Web Framework.
  Tried Hosting on Heroku but due to multiple errors could not deploy the branch(Still trying different methods.)
  - Used Libraries:
    pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.ensemble for RandomForestRegressor, sklearn.model_selection for tain_test_split
  - Performed Hyperparameter tuning for the parameters of RandomForestRegressor like
    (n-estimators, max_features, max_depth, min_samples_spli, min_samples_leaf).
